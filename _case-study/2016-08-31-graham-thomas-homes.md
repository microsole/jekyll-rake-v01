  ### THE CHALLENGE

  At Graham Thomas Home Builders it's all about family, yours and theirs.  The leadership team at Graham Thomas will be the first to tell you that they operate like a family, partly because they have been working together for so long. They have been building custom homes of all prices and sizes in Roanoke, Salem, and New River Valley, Virginia for decades.

  The leadership team recognized that they needed to increase their online presence in order to flourish in a digital world. After all, a home building experience almost always starts with Google. Most consumers do quite a bit of research before ever calling a builder or realtor.  Graham Thomas had a website, but realized that it needed to be modernized to meet the heavy demands and high expectations. of today's consumer.

  ### OUR APPROACH

  Graham Thomas is all about community and legacy.  We set out to build a custom website that is clean and elegant, but not stuffy or arrogant.  We wanted great photography, clear content, and the functionality to give website visitors a fun and interactive experience.

### CMS

Graham Thomas is constantly creating new communities and building new homes.  We knew that meant that we needed to deliver the site in a Content Management System so that Graham Thomas can easily make updates. To make those update simple, we created custom backend WordPress data entry screens.

### PHOTOGRAPHY

We wanted to take modern and fun head shots to show-off the team members who take all of those beautiful homes from blueprint to reality.  The photos genuinely showcase each of their personalities and show the human side of the company.  

### INSPIRATION GALLERY

We wanted a way to be sure that visitors stay on the site longer and have a better experience that keeps them coming back for more. We built an inspiration gallery so that visitors can lose themselves in beautiful home designs. We even created sponsored pages to feature some of their signature partners' images, which then link back to the partner's site.

### SEO

We didn't stop with building the website. We initially optimized it for SEO, continually monitor the traffic, target new long-tail keyphrases, and optimize the content on-going for those keyphrases.
