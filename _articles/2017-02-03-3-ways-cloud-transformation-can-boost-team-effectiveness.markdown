Technology can be both a major opportunity and a major challenge for SMBs today. Technology is defining how businesses grow by changing the old ways of getting things done. Technology is transforming industries, business models, products, services, and even driving the creation of new industries.

**Here's the challenge though**. Because of technology, businesses need to change to survive. They need to develop new capabilities and transform themselves into digital companies, regardless of their industry.

The good news is that with the successful transformation comes many opportunities, including engaging business customers, optimizing operations, reinventing products and business models, and even empowering employees.


## **How can a digital transformation empower your employees and boost effectiveness of your team?**



We work differently than ever before in history. We have more mobile workforces, offer more flexible work styles, and need more information at our fingertips than ever before. To make all this work, employees need to be armed with access to information anytime, anywhere and they need to be empowered to do the right things to move the company forward. All of this ultimately improves employee experiences, which leads to higher levels of employee engagement, which has been proven time and again to be one of the most significant drivers of financial results.


### **Teams Can Work Better Together**



It's no longer a requirement for teams to be sitting in the same room at the same time. Hosting your applications in the cloud enables your team to communicate and work better together across the business, from anywhere. There's no doubt that better digital collaboration boosts agility and service.



	
  * **Document Sharing**. Your teams can share and edit documents in real-time and save those documents in the cloud. They can even work on any device.

	
  * **Virtual Meetings**. Your teams can hold virtual meetings and share content and white boards to communicate quickly and efficiently.

	
  * **Team Effectiveness**. Your teams can communicate business data and insights across teams from anywhere, which undoubtedly increases their effectiveness across the organization.





### **Teams Can Work Anywhere**



Providing anywhere access means making sure that your team has what they need on the go and supporting flexible, mobile ways of working. Hosting applications in the cloud means that employees will have the right information at their fingertips so that they'll be able to get things done in the office or on the go. Team members can provide personalized service because they will be able to access customer information in real-time. They can access all of the information that they need to best service clients, like contracts and project related tasks, from anywhere.



### **Teams Can Work Securely**

### 


In today's environment, the location of data is less important than the accessibility of data. Public cloud service providers have a strong eye towards security and governance. Cloud service providers' brands depend on keeping customer data fully secured, monitored and safe from emerging threats. That means that cloud service providers have experts and massive resources constantly working to ensure that the highest standards are maintained and that its security systems are up-to-date.

To sum up, the cloud can enable your organization to empower your teams. Employees can work better together because they can successfully communicate from anywhere. Employees will have access to their data anywhere they need it. And, that data can be protected anywhere it goes. Productivity and a sense of accomplishment among team members will go a long way towards creating a culture of employee engagement and, ultimately, financial success.
